Pre test

A) Background & VR tolerance. Participant info (ID, age, L1, years of English, VR experience) and a short Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ-style items). 

B) Working memory (covariates). Digit span (forward & backward) and a 9-square spatial span task with adaptive early-stop after two failures. 

C) Phonological discrimination. Minimal-pair SAME/DIFFERENT for English contrasts (L/R, vowel quality, vowel length). Examples include bowl/ball, flour/flower, heat/hit. 

D) Ecological sound mapping (audio iconicity). Foley → action/object/process mapping (e.g., sizzle → “cooking on pan”; granular pour → “flour”). Mappings tagged by type (size↔pitch, texture, action, process). 

E) Visual iconicity. Bouba/kiki-style shape–word pairings plus a domain-specific “bowl shape → container vs cutter” item.

F) L2 picture naming (target vocab). Mic-gated naming of core “pancake” items (e.g., bowl, egg, flour, spatula).
